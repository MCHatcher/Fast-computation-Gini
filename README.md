# Fast-computation-Gini
This repository provides code for fast computation of the Gini coefficient using the bsxfun function in Matlab, plus a fast code based on sorting for cases where N is so large that bsxfun fails due to memory contraints. 
A slower code using explicit calculation is also provided that can easily be translated into any programming language.
